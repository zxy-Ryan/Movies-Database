# movies broswer

## Description
Movies Browser works as its name. It can show movies page by page using TMBD API. It also provides a search by name function. Each movie has a card showing its title, rating and release date. Users can jump to the IMDB page of a certain movie by click on the "Detail" button at the bottom of cards. It returns relative results with the text in the search form when the "Search button" is clicked. Every page shows 25 results if there are more than 25 results. Users can move to the previous or next page by clicking the link at the bottom of the page. 

## Implementation 
Several skills mentioned in the syllabus was used to build this page. jQuery was used to connect to API database. Javascript helped to implement the interactive commands such as searching and turning page. To control the features of contents, I used both existing CSS framework like bootstrap and the CSS file written by hands. Combining these techniques, the page works well on any size of devices.
